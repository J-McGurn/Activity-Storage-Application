# Activity-Storage-Application
Application to store and view completed movies, TV shows, books and games

The application uses MySQL to connect to a database stored on the local user's system.
NOTE: The user must create the local database themselves (template of DB is included)

Once launched, the user can input entries of completed movies, TV shows, books or games by giving information such as title, rating, genres etc.
The information is then displayed in a table for the user to view.
The user may also delete an entry by simply entering the name of the entry they wish to delete.
